# SQL-Project-Music_Store_Analysis

üîç Project Name: Music Store Analysis
üõ†Ô∏è Leveraging SQL for Analysis, including Joins, CTEs, and Subqueries

Database and Tools
PostgreSQL
pgAdmin4

üéß Introduction üéß
In this project, we'll explore a digital music store's data using SQLite to gain insights into its business growth. We will answer some simple questions that will help the store understand its performance, popular music genres, best customers, and more. By leveraging SQL queries, we'll extract meaningful information from the database and visualize key findings to make data-driven decisions.

In this data analysis project, we used SQLite to gain insights into a digital music store's performance. By answering simple questions, we identified the senior most employee, top countries by invoice count, top customers, popular music genres, and more. Leveraging SQL queries and data visualization, we empowered the store to make informed decisions and plan for future growth.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate Functions: I leveraged aggregate functions to analyze sales data, helping me gain insights into which music genres and artists are the most popular among our customers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sub-Queries: Sub-queries proved invaluable when I needed to break down complex queries into manageable parts. They allowed me to fetch specific data from related tables efficiently.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Joins: I seamlessly combined data from multiple tables to create comprehensive reports, connecting customers, products, and sales data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Window Functions: Window functions empowered me to calculate rankings, track trends, and perform time-based analysis, which is crucial in the music industry.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Common Table Expressions (CTE): I employed CTEs to improve query readability and simplify complex operations. They made my SQL code more maintainable and easier to understand.

I'm thrilled with the results of this project, as it allowed me to apply these advanced SQL techniques to real-world data. It's a significant milestone in my SQL journey, and I'm excited to continue expanding my database skills.
